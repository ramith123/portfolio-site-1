## About me

> At the time of writing this "About me" , I am currently a student, studying computer science (Bsc.) in the University of West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago. I lived in Trinidad for almost 13 years now (as of 2020) and was born in Sri Lanka. A far away place where I hope to visit soon (Covid is happening right now.) If you are me and currently reading this in the future, I hope we survived 2020.

Well, a little bit about me that not a lot of people know, I like music, I "play" the guitar. I like to learn new things to keep myself busy, although recent days would contradict that statement. Not a fan of reading, but working on it. I like computers, games etc.... (typical) but I mostly play simulation/strategy games (fs2020 is the best atm) which means I have horrible reflex to play the popular ones. I'm a very big TV-Show guy, you name it, I probably didn't watch it, but I have my favorites.
